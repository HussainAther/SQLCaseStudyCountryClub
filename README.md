# SQL Case Study: Country Club Analysis

## Introduction

This project explores and analyzes data from a Country Club database, using a blend of technologies including MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Jupyter Notebook, and SQLite. Designed to test and enhance your SQL skills, this case study takes you through a series of queries that uncover insights from the Country Club's operational data. By engaging with this case study, you will experience firsthand the methodologies data scientists employ daily to extract meaningful information from databases.

## Project Structure

- **PHPMyAdmin & MySQL**: Initially, you will interact with the Country Club database via PHPMyAdmin, leveraging MySQL for data querying.
- **SQLite & Python**: The latter part of the project involves connecting to a local SQLite database through Python within a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for a seamless integration of SQL querying and data analysis in Python.

Throughout the case study, you will be tasked with a series of questions designed to challenge your ability to translate analytical questions into effective SQL queries.

## Installation and Setup

1. **PHPMyAdmin Access**: Log into PHPMyAdmin using the provided URL, username, and password to access the Country Club database.
   - URL: `https://sql.springboard.com/`
   - Username: `student`
   - Password: `learn_sql@springboard`

2. **Jupyter Notebook Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it via Anaconda or directly through pip.
   - Clone or download the provided notebook to your local machine.

3. **SQLite Database Connection**:
   - The notebook includes instructions for connecting to the SQLite version of the Country Club database. Follow these steps to establish the connection within the notebook.

## Notebook Contents

- **Introduction and Setup**: Initial setup instructions and overview of the database structure.
- **Part 1: PHPMyAdmin Queries**: Solutions and explanations for queries executed in PHPMyAdmin.
- **Part 2: SQLite & Python Analysis**: Further analysis using SQLite connected through a Python interface in Jupyter Notebook. This section dives deeper into data analysis, leveraging pandas and SQL for advanced queries and data manipulation.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this case study, you will:

- Gain practical experience with SQL by executing queries to retrieve and analyze data.
- Learn how to use PHPMyAdmin for database interaction and MySQL for querying.
- Develop skills in connecting to and manipulating databases using SQLite in a Python environment.
- Understand the structure and operations of a typical country club through data analysis.

## Submission Guidelines

Once you have completed the case study, ensure your Jupyter Notebook is fully documented with your SQL queries and analysis. Upload your final notebook to a public GitHub repository and submit the link for review and feedback. Please ensure your repository link is accessible to facilitate the grading process.
