# Country Club Data Analysis Case Study

## Overview

In this case study, you will dive into the fascinating world of data science through the exploration of a Country Club's database. This project will challenge you to utilize a combination of MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Jupyter Notebook, and SQLite to navigate and analyze data effectively. Through this case study, you will gain hands-on experience with real-world data science methodologies, transforming raw data into insightful analyses by crafting precise SQL queries.

Duration: 3 - 6 Hours  
Points: 81  

## Objectives

- Understand and interact with a database using PHPMyAdmin's user-friendly interface.
- Establish a connection to a local SQLite database using Python within a Jupyter Notebook.
- Retrieve specific data points by translating analytical questions into SQL queries.
- Choose between two difficulty tiers based on your confidence level and desire for guidance.

## Difficulty Tiers

### Tier Two

For those who are confident in navigating PHPMyAdmin and establishing a Python connection to a local SQLite database without additional guidance. This tier is recommended for individuals ready to challenge themselves.

### Tier One

Ideal for individuals seeking some guidance through the process of exploring data in PHPMyAdmin and setting up a SQLite connection in Python. This tier provides helpful pointers to assist you in managing complex assignments.
